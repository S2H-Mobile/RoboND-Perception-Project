# RoboND-Perception-Project
This is my solution of the [Perception Project](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project) for the Udacity Robotics Nanodegree.

- The file [writeup.md](https://github.com/S2H-Mobile/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/writeup.md) describes the workflow and solution strategy.
- The Python script [object_recognition.py](https://github.com/S2H-Mobile/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/object_recognition.py) performs the object recognition task.

## Setup and Usage 
1. Follow the setup instructions of the [Udacity Perception Project](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project).
2. Copy the script [object_recognition.py](https://github.com/S2H-Mobile/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/object_recognition.py) in the directory ``/pr2_robot/scripts/``.
3. Follow the instructions in the workflow section of [writeup.md](https://github.com/S2H-Mobile/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/writeup.md) to capture features, train a model and perform object recognition.
